Overriding and Overloading (Objectives 1.5 and 5.4)

  Object type (not the reference variable's type), determines which overridden method is used at runtime.
  Reference type determines which overloaded method will be used at compile time.

Constructors and Instantiation (Objectives 1.6 and 5.4)

  Instance members are accessible only after the super constructor runs.
  Constructors are never inherited, thus they cannot be overridden.
